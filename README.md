# laptop_price_pridiction
This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features using a Random Forest Regressor. The project includes data preprocessing steps, model training, and a Flask web application for accessing the machine learning model.
# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate laptop prices based on features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, and more. The machine learning model is built using the Random Forest Regression algorithm, which is known for its robustness and accuracy in regression tasks.
# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
Model Training: Training a Random Forest Regressor on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.
Flask Application: A web application to interact with the machine learning model.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features related to laptops, such as:

Brand
Model
Processor Type
RAM Size
Storage Capacity
Screen Size
Graphics Card
Operating System
Weight
Price
# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing data points.
Feature Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Standardizing the numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
# Model Training
The Random Forest Regressor is used for training the model. The following steps are involved:

Splitting the Data: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training the Random Forest Regressor on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's parameters to improve performance.
# Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²) Score
# Flask Application
A Flask web application is created to provide an interface for users to interact with the trained model. Users can input the features of a laptop, and the application will predict the price based on the model.
